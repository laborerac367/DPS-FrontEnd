# DPS-FrontEnd

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Dan-Baba/DPS-FrontEnd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Dan-Baba/DPS-FrontEnd)

### Steps to develop
1. Install Node.js
2. Run command `npm install` in project directory.
3. Run command `ng serve -o` to package project, start web server, and open browser to localhost. Any changes made to a file while webserver is running will cause it to be recompiled and served to the browser.
4. If #3 doesn't work, try `npm run ng serve -o`
